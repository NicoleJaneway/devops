# Purpose:
This document was created for WWC DC members who want to pursue AWS certifications and so that we can share references/experiences that can help others study for the exams. 

We encourage you to add your @handle with references, blog posts or even other resources used during your training. 

## How can I study for AWS certs?
### 1. [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/)

#### Who has used this in Women who code DC?

@mmlumba

#### References:
@Palomanat: I used this for most of my Red Hat Certs and I love that they provide very deep content and labs where you don't have to setup your own "infrastructure" to study for a cert. I also used it for AWS CSA and I think it was a good resource because it trained for both the certification and build the confidence I needed to use AWS in a work setting.  
@mmlumba: I initially took this after taking an introductory AWS Developer Course. This helped me because it gave me a more in-depth look of the concepts I learned, quizzes that mimic actual AWS Developer Certification questions, and labs that let me practice either on their own virtual servers or on my own AWS infrastructure.

@palomanat: Currently using this for AWS Developer. The classes are shorter than the ones on Linux Academy and since the AWS CSA and Developer overlap I think I can use a shortcut. 
### 4. [Certified Solutions Architect Official Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Solutions-Architect-Official-Study/dp/1119138558)

@palomanat: I read the whole thing. It's the same as reading every FAQ on the AWS website. I would not recomend this unless you are a person that prefers reading vs video training.
